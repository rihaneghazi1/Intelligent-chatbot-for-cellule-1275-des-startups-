         2. Stronger alignment (easier to maintain shared vision)
         3. More equity per founder
         4. Lower conflict risk
         5. Perfect for MVPs and validation
         6. Easier to coordinate around exam schedules
         7. More feasible to bootstrap (ANSEJ limits may apply)
         8. University projects often succeed with 2-3 members

         Challenges:
         1. Skill gaps may exist
         2. Heavy workload per person
         3. Single point of failure if someone leaves

         Large Team (4-6 People): Only consider if absolutely necessary

         Advantages:
         1. Broader skill coverage
         2. More manpower for complex projects
         3. Built-in redundancy

         - Skill coverage
         - Equity distribution
         - Long-term culture

         Action Plan:

         - You've validated the idea
         - You clearly lack specific skills
         - You can afford equity splits
         3. Use university resources to fill temporary gaps

  utter_underrated_growth_hack:
    - text: |
         There are several uncommon growth strategies that work particularly well for student startups:
         1. Professor champions - Identify innovative professors known for supporting student initiatives who can become powerful advocates within the university system.
         2. Timing around academic events - Align launches with major university events like science fairs and entrepreneurship weeks that happen regularly in Algerian universities.
         3. Regional competition circuits - Participate in competitions hosted by organizations like "Injaz Algeria" or "Algeria Startup Challenge" which provide visibility across multiple universities.
         4. Department partnerships: build relationships with academic departments relevant to your solution. Algerian universities often have hierarchical structures where departmental endorsement can open many doors.

    - text: |
         Regarding skipping classes for your startup:

         4. Find balance by working efficiently rather than just working more hours

         DON'T:
         1. Regularly skip classes as a habit - education is part of your competitive advantage
         2. Miss exams or major assessments that could jeopardize your academic standing
         3. Neglect learning opportunities that might benefit your startup long-term
         4. Isolate yourself from the university ecosystem that could support your growth

         Algerian hack: Remember: maintaining good academic standing often provides legitimacy and access to resources that can benefit your startup.

        Programs like ANADE (ex-ANSEJ) sometimes accept project ideas from youth — especially if it's innovative or tech-based.
 
        🌱 **Start small**: Offer your service/product to people you know, document everything, and apply to:
        - Startup competitions
        - Pitching events
        - NGO programs with microfunding (e.g. UNICEF, UNDP local calls)

        Yes! Here are real Algerian examples:
 
        ✅ **Enactus USTHB 2023**: A student team won funding for their eco-friendly water purification startup, after progressing from local club to national competition.
 
        ✅ **Hult Prize Algeria Finalist 2022**: A solo participant with a mental health app got international mentorship and joined a Berlin startup accelerator.
 
        ✅ **USTHB x GDG Hackathon**: Multiple students received up to 200k DA from sponsor companies for their winning ideas.
 
        These examples prove you don't need to be rich or famous — just consistent, prepared, and engaged in your community!

  utter_mistakes_to_avoid_when_applying:
    - text: |
        Great question! Avoiding these mistakes will increase your chances of success in Algerian funding programs:
 
        🚫 **1. Vague project idea**: Funders want clarity. Make sure your project solves a real problem and is well-defined (goal, audience, timeline).
 
        ❌ **2. No financial plan**: Even a basic cost breakdown is better than nothing. CNAC and ANADE expect you to know your expenses.
 
        🛑 **3. Copy-pasted pitch**: Generic applications = instant rejection. Tailor your application to the program's goal.
 
        😶‍🌫️ **4. Overly ambitious promises**: Don't say you'll "revolutionize the market" with no data. Be realistic and back up your claims.
 
        🧠 **5. Weak personal story**: Your background matters. Highlight your motivation, resilience, or why YOU are the right person to lead this project.
 
        ✔️ **Pro tip**: Always get someone to review your application — a mentor, a teacher, or even me 😏
 
        You've got this!

       - Ensure that local regulations (urban planning or landlord conditions) do not restrict business activity at that address
       - Check that your business activities are compatible with residential use
      
       Some professional activities may require commercial premises due to safety or regulatory requirements."

  utter_ask_startup_alone:
    - text: "Yes, you can absolutely start a startup on your own in Algeria.
      
       The most suitable legal structure for solo entrepreneurs is the EURL (a single-member LLC), which limits personal liability and is officially recognized.
      
       You can also register as an auto-entrepreneur (self-employed) if your business activity fits within the allowed categories for this status.
      
       Starting alone doesn't prevent you from seeking partnerships or expanding your team later as your business grows."
